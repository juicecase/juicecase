# JuiceCase

JuiceCase is a test runner specialized in integration and black box testing (like UI test automation). It provides mechanisms to make work with test data in the form of files and database entities easier with less custom coding required for the test case author.

Much like other test runners for the .NET framework, test cases are designed with a .NET language (like C#). However, unlike unit tests frameworks, JuiceCase isn't only for white box testing and allows test automation engineers to easily write test cases without the need to learn the user interface of one of the various test automation tools, which are often cumbersome to use.

Please note that JuiceCase offers no built-in way of accessing the UI of an application. However, plugins are planned (or already exist) to integrate JuiceCase with existing test automation frameworks (like Ranorex) to enable this. Generally, if the UI automation framework of your choice ofters .NET-compatible modules, you can reference them in your test suites.
